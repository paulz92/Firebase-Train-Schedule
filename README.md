# Firebase Train Schedule

This project will show you a fictional train schedule where user can add trains and view trains added by other users. Remove and add as you please.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project was to incorporate a database into my knowledge base as well as the Moments.js library. Firebase is used here as a first venture into back-end tech.

## Tech/framework used

<b>Built with</b>
- HTML
- CSS
- Google Fonts
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/)
- JavaScript
- jQuery library
- [Moment.js](http://momentjs.com/)
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)

## Features

The UI is meant to replicate a 19th century western setting in which the emergence of railroads and trains fueled western expansion and trade. Users will find a form which they can input train data which will be stored in Firebase and displayed on the page for all users. Moment.js is used to convert the time stamp to a more readable format.

## How to use?

Open the link, check out the trains that are already added (delete one if you'd like), and add your own train as well!
